## Earthquake and Tsunami ODE Simulation

Python-based simulation modeling earthquake motion, tsunami propagation, and aftershock decay using ordinary differential equations and numerical integration with SciPy.

### Features
- Earthquake dynamics modeled as a damped harmonic oscillator
- Aftershock decay inspired by Omori’s Law
- Tsunami wave propagation based on seafloor displacement
- Visualization of displacement, velocity, aftershocks, and wave height over time and distance

### Tools
Python, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
